v2.20  - (TBA)
       - MAJOR: VPNMON-R2 now officially supports WeVPN, including SuperRandom(r) and Multi-Country SuperRandom(r)
         functionality. Please note: WeVPN does not provide server loads (yet), and will incorporate that when it
         becomes available. Also, they don't provide straight IP addresses for their VPN hosts, which makes it
         more difficult to make it compatible with Skynet, so these two options are grayed out.
       - FIXED: Minor code optimizations and tweaks

v2.15  - (August 15, 2022)
       - CHANGED: The order of operations for checkwan, and now occurs directly after the interface tab is drawn.
         It makes sense to perform this operation here, before the WAN0/1 checks are done, in a more optimized
         fashion.  Also, changed the look/feel of the checkwan/load check notifications to fall more in line with
         the rest of the theme.
       - CHANGED: In a dual-WAN scenario, the high ping rule will be disabled should the WAN failover to WAN1,
         due to the fact that it will most likely be a slower more latent device.  In this scenario, this rule
         would most likely cause continuous resets due to higher ping/latency, and is rightly so ignored in this
         particular scenario.
       - FIXED: Minor tweaks and corrections
         
v2.12  - (August 8, 2022)
       - CHANGED: the color scheme to match that of RTRMON and PWRMON a bit more. Seeing a little more uniformity
         and standardization between the three helps calm my OCD. ;)
       - FIXED: realizing that the timezone abbreviation can vary from 1 char to 5 chars across the world, which
         skews the time to the left/right,so I have built in some logic that adjusts the top line that includes
         the current line to ensure that it lines up with the subsequent lines underneath. Yep, another OCD-
         related fix. lol

v2.11  - (August 3, 2022)
       - ADDED: Added a VPN Director rule restart after VPNMON-R2 goes through a reset cycle to help with possible
         compatibility issues in dual WAN/secondary WAN disconnects.
       - FIXED: Minor tweaks and corrections

v2.1   - (July 22, 2022)
       - ADDED: Completely reworked the setup/config menus to make the look/feel/act like RTRMON's. The hope was
         to simplify the process, allowing one to pick and choose settings to configure, instead of having to run
         down a long laundry list of configuration questions. I have done away with the loading of current config
         values as "defaults" when hitting the enter button, as it would be fairly easy to scroll up and see what
         value you had in place if need be. Enter on a blank line now assumes you want the system default.
       - ADDED: An extra round of VPN client kill commands when the router detects WAN trouble, just to make sure
         it pre-emptively kills everything incase these VPN clients try to reconnect while the WAN is down.
       - FIXED: Vastly reworked the logic of the WAN down scenario, and seems to be transitioning much smoother
         through the various stages of dealing with a lost connection. Definitely game-changing!!

v2.01  - (July 17, 2022)
       * ADDED: New logic to determine if a screen session already is running with the alias 'vpnmon-r2'. If there
         is a session running, and you execute another "vpnmon-r2 -screen", it will prompt you whether or not you
         want to just reattach to the already-running session - thanks @Kal1975!
       * FIXED: Better dual-wan logic for those running @Ranger802004's dual-wan script to eliminitate some error
         messages when both WAN0 and WAN1 were connected at the same time. Thanks to @JAX1337 and @Stephen
         Harrington for the heads-up!  Huge thanks To @Ranger802004 for further troubleshooting routing 
         compatibility between our two scripts in a Dual-WAN failover/load balancing situation. Please note, this
         is an interim release until I can dive into Dual-WAN capabilities at a near future date to ensure
         VPNMON-R2 can effectively handle each situation presented to it.

v2.0   - (July 10, 2022)
       * MAJOR: The VPNON.SH project has been sunset. Instead of maintaining almost 2 identical functions in both
         VPNMON-R2 and VPNON, I have decided to terminate the VPNON project. All functionality of VPNON will
         continue to live on in VPNMON-R2.
       * ADDED: The ability to reset the VPN with a "vpnmon-r2.sh -reset" commandline switch.  This gives you the
         same functionality that VPNON gave you, and are able to use this method to randomly reset your VPN 
         connection using CRON jobs. VPNMON-R2 running in its own SSH or Screen window will be aware of these
         actions, will pause the UI while the reset is running, and will resume when finished.
       * ADDED: New indicator showing if one of your pre-configured VPN host slots goes down, and is no longer
         reachable via ping, and will display the affected VPN slot as OFFLINE.
       * Configured an alias for VPNMON-R2 which lets you call all functions relating to the script from any
         location (without having to be in the /jffs/scripts folder or having to call it like
         /jffs/scripts/vpnmon-r2.sh), now using a command like this: "vpnmon-r2 -log"
       * FIXED: Made a few more wording changes in the setup menu thanks to the keen eye of @RimRider, and also
         tweaked the functionality of the menu a bit more.  Now, when calling the setup menu from the UI, you will
         return to the UI when exiting out of the menu.
         
v1.93  - (July 6, 2022)
       * MAJOR: Very happy to announce that VPNMON-R2 is now being included in AMTM! Many thanks to @thelonelycoder
         for his consideration and help getting this included!
       * FIXED: Fixed the logic to dispay the proper router model using some of @thelonelycoder's code which should
         report back the right info from NVRAM.
       * CHANGED: As such, did a few more cleanup items to make menu choices less ambiguous, and creating proper
         exits for items that require an exit vs. going back to a menu.

v1.92  - (July 5, 2022)
       * FIXED: A bug in the setup menu (thanks @kuki68ster), and now checks for the existence of the timeout and
         screen utilities - if they exist, then it just continues on to the configuration menu, bypassing the need
         to answer whether you want to install these two utilities.
       * CHANGED: Resets the terminal colors on exit to play more friendly with other scripts.
       * ADDED: An easter-egg. Let me know if you find it, and if it gave you a chuckle.  ;)

v1.91  - (July 4, 2022)
       * FIXED: Minor wording changes, small bug fixes from some stuff I've noticed while running it to help with
         further increasing stability.
       
v1.9   - (July 3, 2022)
       * ADDED: A fourth qualifier variable thanks to @JAX1337 that will reset the VPN connection if the average
         ping across the tunnel is greater than the specified amount, in the hopes of eliminating a slow connection
         in favor of something a little faster. Please make sure you run through the config to change the default
         of 100ms to something you prefer.
       * ADDED: new functionality thanks to a suggestion from @JAX1337... this option will let you be able to use
         VPNMON-R2 to reset connections based on best speed/ping to your pre-configured VPN client slots. Going
         through the "-config", new question 5 will let you choose whether you want it to randomly pick, or use the
         lowest ping when choosing your VPN servers. In the process, the UI now shows average ping going to each of
         your configured slots, and will notify you on the bottom of the UI if it has found a better server to
         connect to. You have the option in question 5a to specify how many chances you would like your current VPN
         connection to deal with other servers that might have a lower ping, giving your current connection a chance
         to recover. I have found that if you have other servers configured in your vicinity, there's a chance they
         will compete with each other, which would be causing your connection to drop and reconnect to the "now"
         fastest server repeatedly. This configurable counter will help alleviate this behavior. ;)  
       * ADDED: the capability to use a keypress from the main UI to get into the -setup menu using (S), or forcing
         a reset with the {R} key, and of course being able to gracefully exit using the (E) key.  Please note, you
         can press these keys at any time, but they won't get picked up until the main progress bar starts its
         interval count. These keypress options are indicated at the top right of the UI at all times. Sounds like
         an opportunity to build in some Easter Eggs now.  :)
       * CHANGED: Enhanced and simplified some of the setup process when it comes to asking questions about NordVPN,
         SurfShark and PerfectPrivacy, and assigning variables to each. Also completely revamped the -config process
         to either let you start from scratch with default values, or use already existing values that you have
         modified in your current config file. Great suggestion by @iTyPsIDg to prevent you from having to
         continually modify the same entries over and over when a new version comes out.
       * CHANGED: reduced the amount of clutter that a reset produces on the screen, and is much less verbose, and
         looks much cleaner. Using on-screen indicators to show what's currently happening in the script. Will
         continue to refine these.

v1.8   - (June 23, 2022)
       * ADDED: A new row of VPN stats have been added to include current protocol, port, cryptography, and
         authentication digest, just to give you more detailed info pertaining to your current VPN connection.
       * CHANGED: Made some minor changes to the look/feel and layout of the UI, and gave it more of an old-skool
         DOS folders kind of feel.  Please note, I will never be satisfied with the look, and will continue to
         enhance it when I find something else that's pleasing to the eye.  Also, the progress bar will change
         from green to yellow to red as it gets closer to its interval time.

v1.71  - (June 9, 2022)
       * FIXED: Minor fix on the code that handled resets when VPN server loads exceeded a certain amount. The
         code was preventing a reset, unless you were a Perfect Privacy VPN user. Fixed!

v1.7   - (June 4, 2022)
       * SIGNIFICANT: Added capabilities for Perfect Privacy VPN services on VPNMON-R2.  As with the Surfshark
         integration, you get to enjoy all the same features that both Surfshark and NordVPN users get to have. You
         can randomly pick to randomly reconnect one of your VPN slots at a scheduled time, use Perfect Privacy
         SuperRandom functionality to pick one random server within your country, or from multiple countries to
         connect to, and optionally updates Skynet to ensure that your connection experience stays whitelisted at
         all times. Thanks for the suggestion, @Swistheater!
       * SIGNIFICANT: Added the option to leverage your Entware installation in order to utilize the CoreUtils-Timeout
         utility. It is recommended to allow VPNMON-R2 to use this utility in order to cut down on (what I'm
         guessing is) random hardware-level hangups when calling for nvram values specifically on RT-AC86U routers.
         When running VPNMON-R2, it will detect whether or not you have CoreUtils-Timeout installed, and will use
         the utility if it's present. If it's not installed, VPNMON-R2 will just operate as normal. You can install
         this optional utility using the -install switch, and step through option 1.
       * ADDED: Created a new Install menu that you can access by running 'vpnmon-r2.sh -install'.  This option
         will guide the user through installing the optional Entware CoreUtils-Timeout utility, and prompt the
         user to go through the config menu.  You also have the option to force re-install the Entware Timeout
         utility, or go through the vpnmon-r2 uninstall process.
       * FIXED: There was an issue with the Load calculation for Perfect Privacy.  Added corrective measures, and
         should be showing the correct values now!
       * CHANGED: Some code cleanup and other housekeeping items
v1.6   - (May 23, 2022)
       * SIGNIFICANT: Added capabilities for SurfShark VPN services on VPNMON-R2! This is basically a duplication of
         the capabilities that NordVPN users got to enjoy. You can randomly connect to one of your VPN slots at a
         scheduled time, use SurfShark SuperRandom functionality where it will pick random servers for you across
         your country and configure those in your VPN slots, then randomly connect to one.  Also, you can choose up
         to 3 countries to randomly draw from under SuperRandom mode. Looking for feedback from SurfShark users. :)
         - thanks for the suggestion @Phk!
       * ADDED: A log rotation option has been added to the -config, which allows you to specify how large you would
         like your VPNMON-R2.log file to get before it starts trimming it down.  Default will be 1000 lines, which
         should give you several weeks worth of data to sift through.
       * CHANGED: Reworked the script -update function to exit to the -config menu, rather than running the script
         using the -monitor function.  The thinking is people would rather run through the -config immediately after
         due to potentially new functionality that would need to be enabled/disabled.
       * FIXED: the VPN reset date/time counter wasn't resetting after a WAN failure, and now accurately reflects
         when the VPN was last reset.

v1.5   - (May 20, 2022)
       * SIGNIFICANT community testing and development has been done on the WAN up/down functionality... VPNMON-R2 is
         now checking for 2 distinct events -- (1) where the modem is physically off/disconnected, and (2) where the
         modem is on, but the ISP is down/disconnected. I never knew that the router/NVRAM couldn't tell the difference
         until @Stephen Harrington and @iTyPsIDg made this observation. But the end results after testing this is that
         it seems to be able to get past both hurdles now, and successfully re-establish a VPN connection after a
         major event.  Sidenote: I don't think I've brought my internet down this much in the last 10 years total.
         My family thanks you and is praying this is the gold version! LOL. Sincere thanks to everyone involved on
         helping troubleshoot this and jumping in to pull apart this code! You all absolutely rock -- 
         @Stephen Harrington, @SomeWhereOverTheRainBow, @dave14305, @iTyPsIDg ... thank you so much!
       * NEW: Added some extra bonus features and expanded the number of stats to include the WAN state, public-
         facing VPN IP address, as well as ping stats across the WAN interface(s). Should be dual-WAN capable, and
         indicate which WAN interface is active.
       * Crunched the code through shellcheck.net... lots of small changes to formatting of calculations and logic 
         based on its suggestions -- thanks @SomeWhereOverTheRainBow
       * Added a new parameter called "-uninstall" to the list in order to completely uninstall the script (not that
         I'm encouraging you to do so, but at least you can now!) Usage: "vpnmon-r2 -uninstall" -- thanks @andywee
       * Added a new parameter called "-screen", which will kick off VPNMON-R2 using the screen utility so we don't
         have to type this huge commandline each time.  Please note -- requires the "screen" utility to be installed.
         Usage: "vpnmon-r2.sh -screen" -- thanks @Kal1975
       * Added the ability to hit enter on items during the config that were asking for values, and adds default values
         for fill-in-the-blank and yes/no items -- thanks @chongnt
       * Added live feedback during the config process to indicate what you just entered, to hopefully catch any typos
         before getting saved into the config. I thought this would be less messy than showing a huge summary of what
         all entries would be added to the config at the end of the setup process -- thanks @Kal1975
       * Added a WAN connectivity check to the top of the VPN reset function. It will start off by first validating
         whether or not there's a functional WAN connection before attempting to initiate a VPN connection.
       * Added a WAN connectivity check during the regular loop to see if the WAN is up or down based on an SSL
         handshake + verification to 8.8.8.8 (over the WAN connection). If this fails, VPNMON-R2 will fall back to a
         loop, and keep rechecking until the WAN is re-established, then will re-establish the VPN -- thanks @Kal1975
       * Changed the exit VPN city lookup to use the icanhazip.com external/public ip service to help with location
         accuracy -- thanks @Kal1975
       * Some excellent coding suggestions allowed me to eliminate my last [[ ]] wild card match and replace it with a
         fancy grep statement to attempt to catch an error condition when calling the API to check the city name based
         on the IP address -- thanks so much @SomeWhereOverTheRainBow/@iTyPsIDg
       * Added another item to the config menu -- a delayed start-up option -- allowing you to specify how many
         seconds you would like to delay VPNMON-R2 from running after it starts up. This was added to allow for more
         compatibility with other potential scripts that are starting up after a router reboot. Please go through the
         "vpnmon-r2.sh -config" to add this setting -- thanks @Stephen Harrington
       * Fixed: If the avgping value = null, then display 0 until it fixes itself the next time around
       * Fixed: Added some modification to the timing involved in calculating the TX/RX values over the VPN tunnel.
         Due to the time it takes for the WAN to determine connectivity + the NordVPN Load lookup, I'm timing these
         functions to add their results to the entire calculation, hopefully to display slightly more accurate stats.

v1.4   - (May 01, 2022)
       * The big news today is that VPNMON-R2 is now able to integrate with YazFi! Thanks to @iTyPsIDg for the great
         suggestion! Using the setup utility (-config switch), you can now specify which of the 3 x 2.4Ghz, 5Ghz and
         secondary 5Ghz guest networks you want to sync with VPNMON-R2 when it randomly picks a new VPN connection
         and updates the slot number directly in YazFi. This should make life a lot more bearable for those running
         multiple guest networks, and wanting to make use of the full power of randomized VPN connections!  :)
       * The other big news is that VPNMON-R2 can now also accept 2 additional NordVPN countries for a total of 3 
         supported countries to randomly connect to! Also configurable through the setup utility (-config switch),
         you can now specify which additional (up to) 2 countries you want to add.  When VPNMON-R2 goes through it's
         reset function, it will randomly pick from one of the (up to) 3 countries, optionally whitelist all available 
         NordVPN servers for that country in your Skynet firewall, and optionally make a SuperRandom(r) connection
         to one out of the many available servers in the specified country! Yes, we have gone international! Thanks
         goes to @Spud for the excellent suggestion!
       * Some more code cleanup, optimizations and expanded on the config menu to handle the new YazFi and multiple
         country questions during setup.

v1.3   - (Mar 20, 2022)
       * Added another row of stats! The latest additions include near-realtime average RX and TX bandwitdh (in Mbps) 
         across the active VPN tunnel. Also, the current total TX and RX bytes for the VPN tunnel is displayed and 
         gradually increments from when the tunnel was initialized (in Gb). Stats for these bandwith figures are 
         interpreted from an OpenVPN status file that is auto generated when the tunnel is initiated. Please understand 
         that these numbers are generated based on the interval time period you have configured, and may not reflect
         actual real-world amounts. These will give you a good general indicator on what's happening across your VPN.
         That's my disclaimer. ;)
       * The ability to enable/disable these stats is available in the configuration utility (vpnmon-r2.sh -config).
       * I have really taken a liking to the new ASCII art font title for VPNMON-R2, that I have now incorporated it on 
         the top of the main UI. Version number was moved to its right.
       * I have moved the new version alert to directly below the ASCII art font title, and is more discreet in a red
         font in letting you know when a new version is available.

v1.2   - (Mar 17, 2022)
       * Added for the capability of VPNMON-R2 to check for a new version on a periodic basis, and will alert you within
         the interface when a new version becomes available for download. From v1.2 moving forward, the script will
         provide for the capability to check and alert you for new updates.
       * Added a new commandline argument to the list of available commands: "sh vpnmon-r2.sh -update" -- this runs the
         script update utility which downloads and installs the latest version from the github repository.
       * Minor optimizations and enhancements

v1.1   - (Mar 15, 2022)
       * Added an integrated configuration utility that steps you through all available configurable options to give you
         the most compatible experience for your setup. This tools makes the experience much more pleasing than having
         to deal with manually editing (and understanding) the options that were available at the top of the script. The
         configuration tool is called by using the following command: "sh vpnmon-r2.sh -config"
       * Introduced the capability to use commandline arguments to perform various functions in the script. Available
         commands are (1) -h or -help -- to display a quick overview of available commands, (2) -log -- to display the
         contents of the log file within the NANO text editor, (3) -config -- this runs the configuration utility, and
         steps you through all available options, and writes your selections to a config file, and (4) -monitor -- this
         runs VPNMON-R2 under normal monitoring operating conditions to keep an eye on the health of your VPN connection.
       * Moved all working files (config, log and reset log) to its own dedicated folder named "vpnmon-r2.d" under
         "/jffs/addons". The main script can still be found under "/jffs/scripts/vpnmon-r2.sh"
       * Various optimizations and small bug fixes (more like annoyances that bother my OCD).

v1.0   - (Feb 26, 2022)
       * We're at the big v1.0! VPNMON-R2 (and VPNON) have made some huge strides in these 2 short months! ;)
       * Introducting a new NordVPN Server Load stat! In lieu of showing whether or not Skynet is getting updated on the
         stats row, it now shows the NordVPN Server Load thanks to a suggestion by @JackYaz. This Load stat is only
         available if you enable the "UseNordVPN" variable and set it to "1", or if the "NordVPNSuperRandom" variable is set
         to "1". Otherwise, it will default to showing the Skynet stat based on if "UpdateSkynet" is set to "1".
       * A great byproduct to now showing this Load stat, is that another VPN reset can occur if it exceeds a certain
         threshhold. Currently the "NordVPNLoadReset" is set to 50, so if the current NordVPN server you're connected to
         exceeds a 50% load, it will reset the VPN to look for another server with a lesser load. All these items are totally
         configurable at the top of the script.

v0.9   - (Feb 23, 2022)
       * Added a row of stats to the bottom of VPNMON-R2's interface, specifically showing the Low and High ping history for
         the current connection, whether or not Skynet gets updated with NordVPN IPs, and how VPNMON-R2 is currently
         configured, showing either: (a) "VPNMGR" - VPNMON-R2 is integrated with VPNMGR and using its functionality
         periodically to update latest NordVPN/PIA/WeVPN server information into your VPN slots, (b) "NordVPN SuperRandom" - 
         VPNMON-R2 is randomly selecting one of hundreds/thousands of NordVPN servers from within the specified country and 
         populating your VPN slots, and (c) "Standard" - VPNMON-R2 is neither using VPNMGR or SuperRandom functionality, and
         optionally restarting your VPN connections on a random basis based on your set schedule. This is a clean and easy
         way to see how VPNMON-R2 is configured, and giving you some performance stats along with it. Enjoy!         

v0.8   - (Feb 20, 2022)
       * Added the concept of SuperRandom(tm) NordVPN Connections!  This mode, when enabled (NordVPNSuperRandom=1) -- if you 
         choose to be so incredibly daring and adventurous -- will fill your VPN client slots with random VPN servers across
         the country of your choice! Distance, load, and performance be damned!! In the US, the number of available VPN
         servers is up to around 1920, which fluctuates. This option will bypass VPNMGR functionality to update your VPN
         slots with its recommendations (based on chosen city, performance and load). Thus -- it is assumed that each of
         your (up to 5) VPN client slots are fully configured and operational! The SuperRandom(tm) function will only
         replace the "server address" IP and "description" (in a "NordVPN - City" format), and reinitiate the connection as
         usual after losing your connection, having multiple connections going, or after a scheduled reset. Enjoy!

v0.7   - (Feb 18, 2022)
       * Spent a lot of time dealing with a persistent hang issue, and looks to be resolved. I believe the script was running 
         into a race/deadlock type of situation where it would hang during successive NVRAM lookups that were happening too
         close together calling for the same values. I reduced the number of lookups being done, and works flawlessly now.
       * Added some debug commands for future debugging needs, thanks to @eibgrad for his expert help and advice on how to
         accomplish all this.
       * Added a VPNMON-R2.LOG entry that shows when a city lookup is being done through the API.

v0.6   - (Feb 1, 2022) 
       * Added a new API lookup to display the VPN exit nde city/location next to the active VPN connection.  This API is
         free, and guarantees at least 1000 lookups per month. In lieu of doing a lookup each single refresh interval, a 
         location lookup is only done when either the script starts up fresh, when it detects VPNON doing a reset, or if
         VPNMON-R2 initiates a reset. So, hopefuly not more than 1x or 2x/day, or 30x/60x/month, well below the cut-off.
         So here is a disclaimer... lookups are based on your VPN's IP address, and we all know how wrong an IP location
         lookup can be at times when ISP's move IP ranges around, so please understand if it's not displaying the correct
         city at times. So far, it's been pretty darn near 100% correct for me.
       * Enhanced the alert entries in the logs a bit more to make them stand out when we're dealing with a connection
         failure, or multiple connections. VPN failures are now surrounded with asterisks during DEFCON5 level events.
       * Moved the refresh interval indicator to the top row next to the scheduled reset time.
       * Some cosmetics color change enhancements to the output screen and cleaned up the code to make it look more uniform. 
         Need to work on variable naming uniformity next, as that's *ALL* over the place still. Give me time!
       * Replaced the spinner with a decent looking progress bar... spinner was looking long-in-the-tooth. Enjoy!  ;)

v0.5   - (Jan 23, 2022) Wow, where to start... 
       * VPNMON.SH was heavily overhauled into VPNMON-R2.SH to incorporate my other script, VPNON.SH, so that it could act
         standalone, without needing to call a second script. VPNON has now turned into a function within the script.
       * Speaking of which -- I learned lots about functions ;) ... In doing so, I cleaned up some of the inefficient code,
         namely, how it checks for each individual VPN connection. Now, it basically loops from 1 through N and calls the
         function that checks the VPN connection without having to make so much duplication in the code itself.
       * Speaking of functions, I turned the spinner into a function as well. Cleaner and more optimized code is wonderful!
       * I wanted to display the last time VPN was reset, so that it saved this point-in-time each time you restarted
         VPNMON-R2 instead of resetting to 0d 0h 0m, etc. I built functionality that saves the exact time to a file called
         /jffs/scripts/vpnmon-rst.log, from where it reads and populates this time on screen each time a reset occurs.
       * VPNMON-R2 is now also able to perform a regularly scheduled VPN reset without the need to run VPNON.SH through a
         CRU job. This is completely configurable, and now also displays your configured reset time on screen.
       * Also being displayed on screen, is the interval (in seconds) in which it loops to check the validity of your VPN
         connections.
       * Overall, spruced up the look and feel of the visual in your SSH window to show pertinent information without
         cluttering up the screen. Hope you like it!
       * Above all, I wanted to make this script flexible enough for those who aren't running VPNMGR, using NordVPN or
         making use of the Skynet Firewall, so options have been built-in to bypass this functionality to make it usable
         in any VPN usage scenario.

-------------------------------------
VPNMON.SH was deprecated on Jan 22, 2022)

v0.8   - (Jan 20, 2022) 
       * Added a timer to show the last time that the VPN was reset, or, when vpnmon.sh was restarted last, whichever 
         happened most recently.  
       * Also, added a spinner to indicate that the script is still active.  Various optimizations and code clean-up.

v0.7   - (Jan 15, 2022) 
       * Added the avg ping time next to the "Ping is Alive" indicator, which shows avg time in ms across the active VPN
         tunnel to the ping host specified.

v0.6   - (Jan 14, 2022) 
       * Added logging capabilities.  Major events (resets/connection issues/etc) are logged to a file named 
         "vpnmon-on.log" in the /jffs/scripts folder by default. This capability can be disabled by changing the value to 
         "/dev/null". PSA: though it doesn't do a crazy amount of logging, over time it will get larger and larger and will
         eventually impact the total space available in /jffs. Recommend keeping an eye on this, and wiping the 
         "vpnmon-on.log" on occasion.  Will consider adding a more automated log purging feature in the future.  ;)
