Future Enhancements (Planned)
-----------------------------

* spdMerlin integration that changes which VPN tunnel to run speed tests from when the slots change -- thanks @iTyPsIDg
* Other VPN providers that offer API solutions to easier integrate between them and vpnmon-r2

* Other possible stats to display:
   - (completed) snapshot of current upload/download bandwidth amounts going over VPN pipe (if this is even available)
   - (completed) Log purging methodology (Thinking of purging log file 1x/week or 1x/month on a certain weekday or day of the month based on user input/preference)
