I have reposted this great tool here for safekeeping after @eibgrad stopped participating in the forums, and stopped updating
his scripts. The DNS monitor tool is an invaluable script to help diagnose current DNS traffic behavior on your Merlin Asus
router, especially when getting VPNMON-R2 configured using Unbound over VPN.

v1.4.3 (Oct 7, 2023)
  - Modified a few egrep commands, and changed to grep -E as this command may have been controverted.

v1.4.2
  - Original Script as left by @eibgrad
