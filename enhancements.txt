Future Enhancements (Planned)
-----------------------------

To-Do:
------
* Look into more granular city/feature control of VPN slots that won't participate in superrandom
* round robin vpn slots
* Restart script after config changes are made so you don't have to exit & restart
* Include stats row: method of slot selection, % load threshold, ms ping reset

Completed:
----------
* Look into using the Nordvpn Recommended servers option
* After executing vpnmon-r2 -screen, execute the screen window instead of dropping back to a prompt with instructions.
* Add the screen -wipe command
* Only kill the number of VPN slots that are actually configured per VPNMON-R2 config.
* WeVPN integration
* Other VPN providers that offer API solutions to easier integrate between them and vpnmon-r2, starting with NordVPN
   - Surfshark VPN integration (completed)
   - Perfect privacy VPN integration (completed)
* Utilize the ping value going across the tunnel as a parameter to intiate a reset with - thanks @JAX1337 (completed)
* Log purging methodology (Thinking of purging log file 1x/week or 1x/month on a certain weekday or day of the month 
  based on user input/preference) (completed) 
* Other possible stats to display:
   - Snapshot of current upload/download bandwidth amounts going over VPN pipe (if this is even available) (completed)
* Integrate VPNON functionality within VPNMON-R2 itself, as in being able to call a vpn reset function within VPNMON-R2
  and performing the same function as what VPNON does.
