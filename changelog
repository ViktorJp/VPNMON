v0.8 - (Jan 20, 2022) Added a timer to show the last time that the VPN was reset, or, when vpnmon.sh was restarted last,
       whichever happened last.  Also, added a spinner to indicate that the script is still active.  Various optimizations
       and code clean-up.

v0.7 - (Jan 15, 2022) Added the avg ping time next to the "Ping is Alive" indicator, which shows avg time in ms across
       the active VPN tunnel to the ping host specified.

v0.6 - (Jan 14, 2022) Added logging capabilities.  Major events (resets/connection issues/etc) are logged to a file named 
       "vpnmon-on.log" in the /jffs/scripts folder by default.  This capability can be disabled by changing the value to 
       "/dev/null".  PSA: though it doesn't do a crazy amount of logging, over time it will get larger and larger and will
       eventually impact the total space available in /jffs.  Recommend keeping an eye on this, and wiping the 
       "vpnmon-on.log" on occasion.  Will consider adding a more automated log purging feature in the future.  ;)
