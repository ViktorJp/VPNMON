v1.7 - (June 4, 2022)
       * SIGNIFICANT: Added capabilities for Perfect Privacy VPN services on VPNMON-R2.  As with the Surfshark
         integration, you get to enjoy all the same features that both Surfshark and NordVPN users get to have. You
         can randomly pick to randomly reconnect one of your VPN slots at a scheduled time, use Perfect Privacy
         SuperRandom functionality to pick one random server within your country, or from multiple countries to
         connect to, and optionally updates Skynet to ensure that your connection experience stays whitelisted at
         all times. Thanks for the suggestion, @Swistheater!
       * SIGNIFICANT: Added the option to leverage your Entware installation in order to utilize the CoreUtils-Timeout
         utility. It is recommended to allow VPNMON-R2 to use this utility in order to cut down on (what I'm
         guessing is) random hardware-level hangups when calling for nvram values specifically on RT-AC86U routers.
         When running VPNMON-R2, it will detect whether or not you have CoreUtils-Timeout installed, and will use
         the utility if it's present. If it's not installed, VPNMON-R2 will just operate as normal. You can install
         this optional utility using the -install switch, and step through option 1.
       * ADDED: Created a new Install menu that you can access when running 'vpnmon-r2.sh -install'.  This option
         will guide the user through installing the optional Entware CoreUtils-Timeout utility, and prompt the
         user to go through the config menu.  You also have the option to force re-install the Entware Timeout
         utility, or go through the vpnmon-r2 uninstall process.
       * FIXED: There was an issue with the Load calculation for Perfect Privacy.  Added corrective measures, and
         should be showing the correct values now!
       * CHANGED: Some code cleanup and other housekeeping items
v1.6 - (May 23, 2022)
       * SIGNIFICANT: Added capabilities for SurfShark VPN services on VPNMON-R2! This is basically a duplication of
         the capabilities that NordVPN users got to enjoy. You can randomly connect to one of your VPN slots at a
         scheduled time, use SurfShark SuperRandom functionality where it will pick random servers for you across
         your country and configure those in your VPN slots, then randomly connect to one.  Also, you can choose up
         to 3 countries to randomly draw from under SuperRandom mode. Looking for feedback from SurfShark users. :)
         - thanks for the suggestion @Phk!
       * ADDED: A log rotation option has been added to the -config, which allows you to specify how large you would
         like your VPNMON-R2.log file to get before it starts trimming it down.  Default will be 1000 lines, which
         should give you several weeks worth of data to sift through.
       * CHANGED: Reworked the script -update function to exit to the -config menu, rather than running the script
         using the -monitor function.  The thinking is people would rather run through the -config immediately after
         due to potentially new functionality that would need to be enabled/disabled.
       * FIXED: the VPN reset date/time counter wasn't resetting after a WAN failure, and now accurately reflects
         when the VPN was last reset.

v1.5 - (May 20, 2022)
       * SIGNIFICANT community testing and development has been done on the WAN up/down functionality... VPNMON-R2 is
         now checking for 2 distinct events -- (1) where the modem is physically off/disconnected, and (2) where the
         modem is on, but the ISP is down/disconnected. I never knew that the router/NVRAM couldn't tell the difference
         until @Stephen Harrington and @iTyPsIDg made this observation. But the end results after testing this is that
         it seems to be able to get past both hurdles now, and successfully re-establish a VPN connection after a
         major event.  Sidenote: I don't think I've brought my internet down this much in the last 10 years total.
         My family thanks you and is praying this is the gold version! LOL. Sincere thanks to everyone involved on
         helping troubleshoot this and jumping in to pull apart this code! You all absolutely rock -- 
         @Stephen Harrington, @SomeWhereOverTheRainBow, @dave14305, @iTyPsIDg ... thank you so much!
       * NEW: Added some extra bonus features and expanded the number of stats to include the WAN state, public-
         facing VPN IP address, as well as ping stats across the WAN interface(s). Should be dual-WAN capable, and
         indicate which WAN interface is active.
       * Crunched the code through shellcheck.net... lots of small changes to formatting of calculations and logic 
         based on its suggestions -- thanks @SomeWhereOverTheRainBow
       * Added a new parameter called "-uninstall" to the list in order to completely uninstall the script (not that
         I'm encouraging you to do so, but at least you can now!) Usage: "vpnmon-r2 -uninstall" -- thanks @andywee
       * Added a new parameter called "-screen", which will kick off VPNMON-R2 using the screen utility so we don't
         have to type this huge commandline each time.  Please note -- requires the "screen" utility to be installed.
         Usage: "vpnmon-r2.sh -screen" -- thanks @Kal1975
       * Added the ability to hit enter on items during the config that were asking for values, and adds default values
         for fill-in-the-blank and yes/no items -- thanks @chongnt
       * Added live feedback during the config process to indicate what you just entered, to hopefully catch any typos
         before getting saved into the config. I thought this would be less messy than showing a huge summary of what
         all entries would be added to the config at the end of the setup process -- thanks @Kal1975
       * Added a WAN connectivity check to the top of the VPN reset function. It will start off by first validating
         whether or not there's a functional WAN connection before attempting to initiate a VPN connection.
       * Added a WAN connectivity check during the regular loop to see if the WAN is up or down based on an SSL
         handshake + verification to 8.8.8.8 (over the WAN connection). If this fails, VPNMON-R2 will fall back to a
         loop, and keep rechecking until the WAN is re-established, then will re-establish the VPN -- thanks @Kal1975
       * Changed the exit VPN city lookup to use the icanhazip.com external/public ip service to help with location
         accuracy -- thanks @Kal1975
       * Some excellent coding suggestions allowed me to eliminate my last [[ ]] wild card match and replace it with a
         fancy grep statement to attempt to catch an error condition when calling the API to check the city name based
         on the IP address -- thanks so much @SomeWhereOverTheRainBow/@iTyPsIDg
       * Added another item to the config menu -- a delayed start-up option -- allowing you to specify how many
         seconds you would like to delay VPNMON-R2 from running after it starts up. This was added to allow for more
         compatibility with other potential scripts that are starting up after a router reboot. Please go through the
         "vpnmon-r2.sh -config" to add this setting -- thanks @Stephen Harrington
       * Fixed: If the avgping value = null, then display 0 until it fixes itself the next time around
       * Fixed: Added some modification to the timing involved in calculating the TX/RX values over the VPN tunnel.
         Due to the time it takes for the WAN to determine connectivity + the NordVPN Load lookup, I'm timing these
         functions to add their results to the entire calculation, hopefully to display slightly more accurate stats.

v1.4 - (May 01, 2022)
       * The big news today is that VPNMON-R2 is now able to integrate with YazFi! Thanks to @iTyPsIDg for the great
         suggestion! Using the setup utility (-config switch), you can now specify which of the 3 x 2.4Ghz, 5Ghz and
         secondary 5Ghz guest networks you want to sync with VPNMON-R2 when it randomly picks a new VPN connection
         and updates the slot number directly in YazFi. This should make life a lot more bearable for those running
         multiple guest networks, and wanting to make use of the full power of randomized VPN connections!  :)
       * The other big news is that VPNMON-R2 can now also accept 2 additional NordVPN countries for a total of 3 
         supported countries to randomly connect to! Also configurable through the setup utility (-config switch),
         you can now specify which additional (up to) 2 countries you want to add.  When VPNMON-R2 goes through it's
         reset function, it will randomly pick from one of the (up to) 3 countries, optionally whitelist all available 
         NordVPN servers for that country in your Skynet firewall, and optionally make a SuperRandom(r) connection
         to one out of the many available servers in the specified country! Yes, we have gone international! Thanks
         goes to @Spud for the excellent suggestion!
       * Some more code cleanup, optimizations and expanded on the config menu to handle the new YazFi and multiple
         country questions during setup.

v1.3 - (Mar 20, 2022)
       * Added another row of stats! The latest additions include near-realtime average RX and TX bandwitdh (in Mbps) 
         across the active VPN tunnel. Also, the current total TX and RX bytes for the VPN tunnel is displayed and 
         gradually increments from when the tunnel was initialized (in Gb). Stats for these bandwith figures are 
         interpreted from an OpenVPN status file that is auto generated when the tunnel is initiated. Please understand 
         that these numbers are generated based on the interval time period you have configured, and may not reflect
         actual real-world amounts. These will give you a good general indicator on what's happening across your VPN.
         That's my disclaimer. ;)
       * The ability to enable/disable these stats is available in the configuration utility (vpnmon-r2.sh -config).
       * I have really taken a liking to the new ASCII art font title for VPNMON-R2, that I have now incorporated it on 
         the top of the main UI. Version number was moved to its right.
       * I have moved the new version alert to directly below the ASCII art font title, and is more discreet in a red
         font in letting you know when a new version is available.

v1.2 - (Mar 17, 2022)
       * Added for the capability of VPNMON-R2 to check for a new version on a periodic basis, and will alert you within
         the interface when a new version becomes available for download. From v1.2 moving forward, the script will
         provide for the capability to check and alert you for new updates.
       * Added a new commandline argument to the list of available commands: "sh vpnmon-r2.sh -update" -- this runs the
         script update utility which downloads and installs the latest version from the github repository.
       * Minor optimizations and enhancements

v1.1 - (Mar 15, 2022)
       * Added an integrated configuration utility that steps you through all available configurable options to give you
         the most compatible experience for your setup. This tools makes the experience much more pleasing than having
         to deal with manually editing (and understanding) the options that were available at the top of the script. The
         configuration tool is called by using the following command: "sh vpnmon-r2.sh -config"
       * Introduced the capability to use commandline arguments to perform various functions in the script. Available
         commands are (1) -h or -help -- to display a quick overview of available commands, (2) -log -- to display the
         contents of the log file within the NANO text editor, (3) -config -- this runs the configuration utility, and
         steps you through all available options, and writes your selections to a config file, and (4) -monitor -- this
         runs VPNMON-R2 under normal monitoring operating conditions to keep an eye on the health of your VPN connection.
       * Moved all working files (config, log and reset log) to its own dedicated folder named "vpnmon-r2.d" under
         "/jffs/addons". The main script can still be found under "/jffs/scripts/vpnmon-r2.sh"
       * Various optimizations and small bug fixes (more like annoyances that bother my OCD).

v1.0 - (Feb 26, 2022)
       * We're at the big v1.0! VPNMON-R2 (and VPNON) have made some huge strides in these 2 short months! ;)
       * Introducting a new NordVPN Server Load stat! In lieu of showing whether or not Skynet is getting updated on the
         stats row, it now shows the NordVPN Server Load thanks to a suggestion by @JackYaz. This Load stat is only
         available if you enable the "UseNordVPN" variable and set it to "1", or if the "NordVPNSuperRandom" variable is set
         to "1". Otherwise, it will default to showing the Skynet stat based on if "UpdateSkynet" is set to "1".
       * A great byproduct to now showing this Load stat, is that another VPN reset can occur if it exceeds a certain
         threshhold. Currently the "NordVPNLoadReset" is set to 50, so if the current NordVPN server you're connected to
         exceeds a 50% load, it will reset the VPN to look for another server with a lesser load. All these items are totally
         configurable at the top of the script.

v0.9 - (Feb 23, 2022)
       * Added a row of stats to the bottom of VPNMON-R2's interface, specifically showing the Low and High ping history for
         the current connection, whether or not Skynet gets updated with NordVPN IPs, and how VPNMON-R2 is currently
         configured, showing either: (a) "VPNMGR" - VPNMON-R2 is integrated with VPNMGR and using its functionality
         periodically to update latest NordVPN/PIA/WeVPN server information into your VPN slots, (b) "NordVPN SuperRandom" - 
         VPNMON-R2 is randomly selecting one of hundreds/thousands of NordVPN servers from within the specified country and 
         populating your VPN slots, and (c) "Standard" - VPNMON-R2 is neither using VPNMGR or SuperRandom functionality, and
         optionally restarting your VPN connections on a random basis based on your set schedule. This is a clean and easy
         way to see how VPNMON-R2 is configured, and giving you some performance stats along with it. Enjoy!         

v0.8 - (Feb 20, 2022)
       * Added the concept of SuperRandom(tm) NordVPN Connections!  This mode, when enabled (NordVPNSuperRandom=1) -- if you 
         choose to be so incredibly daring and adventurous -- will fill your VPN client slots with random VPN servers across
         the country of your choice! Distance, load, and performance be damned!! In the US, the number of available VPN
         servers is up to around 1920, which fluctuates. This option will bypass VPNMGR functionality to update your VPN
         slots with its recommendations (based on chosen city, performance and load). Thus -- it is assumed that each of
         your (up to 5) VPN client slots are fully configured and operational! The SuperRandom(tm) function will only
         replace the "server address" IP and "description" (in a "NordVPN - City" format), and reinitiate the connection as
         usual after losing your connection, having multiple connections going, or after a scheduled reset. Enjoy!
       * The NordVPNCountry variable is now available for you to populate with the country of your choice without having to
         mess around with the code. These are all available country names to choose from: Albania, Argentina, Australia,
         Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech
         Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, Iceland, India,
         Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Mexico, Moldova, Netherlands,
         New Zealand, North Macedonia, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South
         Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United
         Kingdom, United States, Vietnam.
       * Other code optimizations, error catching, and formatting fixes just to make it more pleasing to the eye. ;)

v0.7 - (Feb 18, 2022)
       * Spent a lot of time dealing with a persistent hang issue, and looks to be resolved. I believe the script was running 
         into a race/deadlock type of situation where it would hang during successive NVRAM lookups that were happening too
         close together calling for the same values. I reduced the number of lookups being done, and works flawlessly now.
       * Added some debug commands for future debugging needs, thanks to @eibgrad for his expert help and advice on how to
         accomplish all this.
       * Added a VPNMON-R2.LOG entry that shows when a city lookup is being done through the API.

v0.6 - (Feb 1, 2022) 
       * Added a new API lookup to display the VPN exit nde city/location next to the active VPN connection.  This API is
         free, and guarantees at least 1000 lookups per month. In lieu of doing a lookup each single refresh interval, a 
         location lookup is only done when either the script starts up fresh, when it detects VPNON doing a reset, or if
         VPNMON-R2 initiates a reset. So, hopefuly not more than 1x or 2x/day, or 30x/60x/month, well below the cut-off.
         So here is a disclaimer... lookups are based on your VPN's IP address, and we all know how wrong an IP location
         lookup can be at times when ISP's move IP ranges around, so please understand if it's not displaying the correct
         city at times. So far, it's been pretty darn near 100% correct for me.
       * Enhanced the alert entries in the logs a bit more to make them stand out when we're dealing with a connection
         failure, or multiple connections. VPN failures are now surrounded with asterisks during DEFCON5 level events.
       * Moved the refresh interval indicator to the top row next to the scheduled reset time.
       * Some cosmetics color change enhancements to the output screen and cleaned up the code to make it look more uniform. 
         Need to work on variable naming uniformity next, as that's *ALL* over the place still. Give me time!
       * Replaced the spinner with a decent looking progress bar... spinner was looking long-in-the-tooth. Enjoy!  ;)

v0.5 - (Jan 23, 2022) Wow, where to start... 
       * VPNMON.SH was heavily overhauled into VPNMON-R2.SH to incorporate my other script, VPNON.SH, so that it could act
         standalone, without needing to call a second script. VPNON has now turned into a function within the script.
       * Speaking of which -- I learned lots about functions ;) ... In doing so, I cleaned up some of the inefficient code,
         namely, how it checks for each individual VPN connection. Now, it basically loops from 1 through N and calls the
         function that checks the VPN connection without having to make so much duplication in the code itself.
       * Speaking of functions, I turned the spinner into a function as well. Cleaner and more optimized code is wonderful!
       * I wanted to display the last time VPN was reset, so that it saved this point-in-time each time you restarted
         VPNMON-R2 instead of resetting to 0d 0h 0m, etc. I built functionality that saves the exact time to a file called
         /jffs/scripts/vpnmon-rst.log, from where it reads and populates this time on screen each time a reset occurs.
       * VPNMON-R2 is now also able to perform a regularly scheduled VPN reset without the need to run VPNON.SH through a
         CRU job. This is completely configurable, and now also displays your configured reset time on screen.
       * Also being displayed on screen, is the interval (in seconds) in which it loops to check the validity of your VPN
         connections.
       * Overall, spruced up the look and feel of the visual in your SSH window to show pertinent information without
         cluttering up the screen. Hope you like it!
       * Above all, I wanted to make this script flexible enough for those who aren't running VPNMGR, using NordVPN or
         making use of the Skynet Firewall, so options have been built-in to bypass this functionality to make it usable
         in any VPN usage scenario.

-------------------------------------
VPNMON.SH was deprecated on Jan 22, 2022)

v0.8 - (Jan 20, 2022) 
       * Added a timer to show the last time that the VPN was reset, or, when vpnmon.sh was restarted last, whichever 
         happened most recently.  
       * Also, added a spinner to indicate that the script is still active.  Various optimizations and code clean-up.

v0.7 - (Jan 15, 2022) 
       * Added the avg ping time next to the "Ping is Alive" indicator, which shows avg time in ms across the active VPN
         tunnel to the ping host specified.

v0.6 - (Jan 14, 2022) 
       * Added logging capabilities.  Major events (resets/connection issues/etc) are logged to a file named 
         "vpnmon-on.log" in the /jffs/scripts folder by default. This capability can be disabled by changing the value to 
         "/dev/null". PSA: though it doesn't do a crazy amount of logging, over time it will get larger and larger and will
         eventually impact the total space available in /jffs. Recommend keeping an eye on this, and wiping the 
         "vpnmon-on.log" on occasion.  Will consider adding a more automated log purging feature in the future.  ;)
       
v0.5 - Initial release of VPNMON.SH (Jan 12, 2022)
