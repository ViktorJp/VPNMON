v0.6 - (Feb 1, 2022) 
       * Added a new API lookup to display the VPN Exit Node city/location next to the active VPN connection.  This API is
         free, and guarantees at least 1000 lookups per month.  In lieu of doing a lookup each single interval, a location
         lookup is only done when either the script starts up fresh, when it detects VPNON doing a reset, or if VPNMON-R2
         initiates a reset.  So, hopefuly not more than 1x or 2x/day, or 30x/60x/month, well below the cut-off.
       * Enhanced the alert entries in the logs a bit more to make them stand out when we're dealing with a connection
         failure, or multiple connections.
       * Moved the interval indicator to the top row next to the scheduled reset time
       * Some cosmetics color change enhancements to the output screen and cleaned up the code to make it look more uniform. 
         Need to work on variable naming uniformity next, as that's *ALL* over the place still.
       * Replaced the spinner with a decent looking progress bar... spinner was looking long-in-the-tooth.  ;)

v0.5 - (Jan 23, 2022) Wow, where to start... 
       * VPNMON.SH was heavily overhauled into VPNMON-R2.SH to incorporate my other script, VPNON.SH, so that it could act
         standalone, without needing to call a second script. VPNON has now turned into a function within the script.
       * Speaking of which -- I learned lots about functions ;) ... In doing so, I cleaned up some of the inefficient code,
         namely, how it checks for each individual VPN connection. Now, it basically loops from 1 through N and calls the
         function that checks the VPN connection without having to make so much duplication in the code itself.
       * Speaking of functions, I turned the spinner into a function as well.  Cleaner and more optimized code is wonderful!
       * I wanted to display the last time VPN was reset, so that it saved this point-in-time each time you restarted
         VPNMON-R2 instead of resetting to 0d 0h 0m, etc. I built functionality that saves the exact time to a file called
         /jffs/scripts/vpnmon-rst.log, from where it reads and populates this time on screen each time a reset occurs.
       * VPNMON-R2 is now also able to perform a regularly scheduled VPN reset without the need to run VPNON.SH through a
         CRU job.  This is completely configurable, and now also displays your configured reset time on screen.
       * Also being displayed on screen, is the interval (in seconds) in which it loops to check the validity of your VPN
         connections.
       * Overall, spruced up the look and feel of the visual in your SSH window to show pertinent information without
         cluttering up the screen.  Hope you like it!
       * Above all, I wanted to make this script flexible enough for those who aren't running VPNMGR, using NordVPN or
         making use of the Skynet Firewall, so options have been built-in to bypass this functionality to make it usable
         in any VPN usage scenario.

-------------------------------------
VPNMON.SH was deprecated on Jan 22, 2022)

v0.8 - (Jan 20, 2022) 
       * Added a timer to show the last time that the VPN was reset, or, when vpnmon.sh was restarted last, whichever 
         happened most recently.  
       * Also, added a spinner to indicate that the script is still active.  Various optimizations and code clean-up.

v0.7 - (Jan 15, 2022) 
       * Added the avg ping time next to the "Ping is Alive" indicator, which shows avg time in ms across the active VPN
         tunnel to the ping host specified.

v0.6 - (Jan 14, 2022) 
       * Added logging capabilities.  Major events (resets/connection issues/etc) are logged to a file named 
         "vpnmon-on.log" in the /jffs/scripts folder by default.  This capability can be disabled by changing the value to 
         "/dev/null".  PSA: though it doesn't do a crazy amount of logging, over time it will get larger and larger and will
         eventually impact the total space available in /jffs.  Recommend keeping an eye on this, and wiping the 
         "vpnmon-on.log" on occasion.  Will consider adding a more automated log purging feature in the future.  ;)
